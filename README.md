# URL-Phishing-Detection

Nir-Meir, Ilan Sirsky

This project involves the detection of anomalous or outlier hosts within a network dataset. Working in pairs, the goal is to explore the data, select appropriate algorithms, and create a solution for anomaly detection. The project includes the following components:

Data Exploration: Investigate the dataset, which consists of connection records with features such as record ID, duration, source bytes, and destination bytes. Extract insights from the data to gain a better understanding of the characteristics.

Algorithm Selection: Choose suitable algorithms for anomaly detection and explain the rationale behind the selection. Consider algorithms that can effectively capture anomalies in network behavior.

Report Creation: Create a detailed report outlining the approach taken to solve the problem. Explain the chosen algorithms, justify their suitability, and discuss how their performance is evaluated.

Performance Evaluation: Develop a model that detects anomalies and assess its accuracy and recall. Present the confusion matrix and rank performance based on the class results.

Docker Implementation: Build a Docker application with a user interface (UI) for incident prediction. The UI allows users to input incidents and receive predictions regarding their anomaly status.
